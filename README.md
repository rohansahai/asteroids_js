## Monkey Trouble

This game closely resembles the popular arcade game asteroids. However in my version, you are a monkey who has to collect bananas(ammo), to shoot at the zookeepers. 

This is an object oriented program with carefully constructed classes!

There are classes for each the Ship (monkey), Asteroids (zookeepers), and bullets (bananas). Each of these classes inherits from a parent class MovingObject. The MovingObject class has position, velocity, size and more. These properties essentially determine how the object is rendered in our canvas.

There is also a game class that handles the actual logic of the game.
